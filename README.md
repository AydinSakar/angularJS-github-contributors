AngularJS GitHub Contributors
=============================

This project is a port of the YUI 3.5 app
[GitHub Contributors] to [AngularJS].

The CSS has been taken unchanged from the original app. The html
structure has also been taken from the original app, but it has been
modified to work with [AngularJS].

Known differenses between this port and the original app:

* No pluralization of the word _contributor_ in the on hover title, of
  the contributors thumbs.
* One more json query to GitHub, 4 instead of 3.
* Fewer lines of javascript code, 91 compared to 387, excluding lines
  with comments and empty lines!
