This project is intended to be a clone of the YUI 3.5 app [GitHub Contributors](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/app/app-contributors.html) but instead of YUI 3.5 in [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

I have stolen the CSS and the html structure from the YUI 3.5 app, but adapted the html to work with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

Known differenses between the original version and this version in [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) is:

* No pluralization of the word _contributor_ in the on hover title, of the contributors thumbs.
* One more json query to GitHub, 4 instead of 3.
* Fewer lines of javascript code, 91 compared to 387, excluding lines with comments and empty lines!
